When I clicked on the pet "Bubba" you can see its hunger level, happiness level, and when it was born/created. The video below demonstrates the use of the play, feed, scold, and delete functions: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76697333/110017780-9777b000-7cf4-11eb-9798-4a359b003253.mov


Assignemt Overview: 

Design a front end application that has multiple features and pages.


	1. Have fun with the styling. Make your CSS neat and presentable, but apply your creativity!
	2. The home page should show a list of all the pets in your API. The listing should include their name, birthday, hunger level, and happiness level.
	3. Add a form to your home page to input a new pet's name and use your "CREATE" API to make a new pet. The list of pets should refresh.
	4. Make each pet on the home page a <Link> to a page showing the pet's detail. The detail page should show the name, birthday, hunger level, and happiness level.
	5. On the detail page, add buttons to: -Play with the pet- -Feed the pet- -Scold the pet-
	6. After each of the above actions, reload the data for the pet (use React to do this, NOT a force page reload)
	7.Add a button to delete a pet. After deletion, redirect the user to the home page
	8.Add a link on the detail page to navigate to the home page.
